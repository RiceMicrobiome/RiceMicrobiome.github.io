It was windy this week so we had to keep the paper towels down with the sample tubes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Edwards</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-07-01:FE-Week8.html</guid><category>Field Experiment</category><category>Arbuckle</category></item><item><title>Field Experiment Week 7</title><link>/FE-Week7.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/fieldw7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We had a guest collector this week.  Meet Eugene.  He's like this all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/plantsw5.jpg" /&gt;
Check out the plants! They're starting to tiller.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Edwards</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-06-10:FE-Week5.html</guid><category>Field Experiment</category><category>Arbuckle</category></item><item><title>Field Experiment Week 4</title><link>/FE-Week4.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week the farmer applied some herbicide to try and get rid of some of the weeds in the paddy.  We usually collect on Tuesdays, but because he applied the herbicide on Tuesday we had to wait until Thursday to do the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The field during the 4th week" src="/images/fieldw4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that there are tracks in the field where they've taken the tractor through to spray.  I made the mistake of stepping in one of the tracks.  It's deeper than my boot and my foot got wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The plants during the fourth week" src="/images/plantsw4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants are growing fast!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Edwards</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-06-05:FE-Week4.html</guid><category>Field Experiment</category><category>Arbuckle</category></item><item><title>Field Experiment Week 3</title><link>/FE-Week3.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Three weeks in and the plants are growing like crazy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's nothing really special to report this week other than this is the first week that Chris hasn't lost his boot in the mud.  Exciting news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chris marching around" src="/images/chrisw3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Edwards</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-05-27:FE-Week3.html</guid><category>Field Experiment</category><category>Arbuckle</category></item><item><title>Field Experiment Week 2</title><link>/FE-Week2.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week we watched the field being seeded and only collected soil for microbiome analysis.  This week the seedlings have germinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The field during the second week" src="/images/fieldw2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see where we walked out to sample.  It was hard work.  We bought big rubber boots go go out there, but it's easy to get stuck.  Once you're in the mud, you kind of master a rocking motion to keep your feet moving.  Regardless, Chris lost his boot and got his feet wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seedlings had germinated at this point (you can't see it in this picture). The farmers drain the field three days after seeding.  This process stimulates the plants to start rooting.  So this picture was taken in the reflooding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out into the field and collected the seedlings.  This is what they look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The rice seedlings in the second week" src="/images/plantsw2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Edwards</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-05-20:FE-Week2.html</guid><category>Field Experiment</category><category>Arbuckle</category></item><item><title>Field Experiment Week 1</title><link>/FE-Week1.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently we've had some success with taking a network approach for studying microbial consortia.  This has been accomplished by using the variation in microbial abundance between rhizocompartments, field sites, and cultivation practice.  We found consortia of OTUs belonging to taxonomies with the potential for metabolism of methane (we found taxonomies involved in methane formation, oxidation, and sytrophs in the same modules of the larger network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our networks were formed by using information captured at one time point.  Perhaps what is more interesting is to form these networks under a timecourse framework.  With this method, we can monitor how methanogens, methanotrophs, and syntrophs exist in and around the roots through time.  There is solid evidence that methane emissions from rice paddies increases sharply when the rice plants are flowering.  Will we see methane cycling consortia mimicking this pattern?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions being addressed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the many questions that I'm trying to address with a field based experiment where we are sampling from a &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/N70b9"&gt;rice field in Arbuckle, CA&lt;/a&gt;.  There are also other interesting factors that we can study with this experiment.  For instance, we can see how rice developmental stage effects the root-associated microbiome and how different agricultural based ammendments can change the microbiome on a week to week basis.  The farmer periodically applies herbicide and nitrogen ammendments to the soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be ideal if we could do this with multiple fields to get solid correlations between for treatments, developmental stage, etc.  Unfortunately we do not have enough man power at the time to do collections everyweek from multiple sites across the central valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we're left with is giant field.  Thankfully the farmer only wanted us to sample from one corner of the field, so we're not stomping all over his plants.  This made our experimental layout easier; but if I were left to my own devices we would have stomped all around that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got there, they were seeding the field by plane.  In case you didn't know, many Californian rice fields are seeded by airplane.  They soak the seeds in water for 24 hours prior to seeding and then spray them out of the back of an airplane.  The soaking of the seeds ensures that they sink to the bottom of the flooded paddy and they don't just float to one corner of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="They seed the fields by crop dusters!" src="/images/duster2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they had just seeded the field that day and there were no roots to sample we decided to just sample the soil, take it back to the lab, and extract the DNA to get a good idea of the starting microbial pool.&lt;/p&gt;
